Asyncio basics: basic theory
============================

- Get the best practices from other frameworks `Twisted`, `Tornado`, etc.
- Concurrence via coroutines, these can be paused and rescheduled  
- First implementation via iterators, since 3.5 as an internal and specific implementation.
- Designed to build other frameworks upon it. `Tornado with Asyncio <http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/asyncio.html>`_

----

Asyncio basics: Coroutine
=========================

- Bound to a Python function: With the `async def` statement or the `@asyncio.coroutine` decorator 
- Calling a coroutine does not start the code automatically: `await` and `yieldÂ from` do that implicitly.
- Once paused it is rescheduled by the loop because of a I/O event, by time, etc.
- Magic methods cant be defined as coroutines : `__init__`, `__cmp__`, etc

----

Asyncio basics: Coroutine
=========================

The basic example, running a coroutine

.. code-block:: python 

    import asyncio

    async def do_something():
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(do_something())

----

Asyncio basics: Coroutine
=========================

Calling a coroutine and waiting for the result, becoming a croutine.

.. code-block:: python 

    async def bar():
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        return 1 + 1

    async def foo():
        result = await bar()

----

Asyncio basics: Future
======================

Intermediate object to set results in the past and gather them into the Future

.. code-block:: python 

    from time import sleep

    def foo(f):
        sleep(1)
        f.set_result(10)

    f = asyncio.Future()
    foo(f)
    f.result()

----

Asyncio basics: Future
======================

*Damm it*, this is not asynchronous. What is going on?.

*Future* should be treated as a **synchronization object, used by a consumer and producer**.
It almost meets the same requirements than the threading flavor called `concurrent.futures.Future`

As an example have a look to the code to `set the results <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/asyncio/futures.py#L284>`_.

----

Asyncio basics: Future
======================

The `await` expression is compatible with futures.

.. code-block:: python 

    def bar():
        f = asyncio.Future()
        f.set_result(10)
        return f

    async def foo():
        result = await bar()
        print(result)

----

Asyncio basics: Task
====================

- Unit of a concurrent asynchronous work.
- As an example each http request is handled as a task by `aiohttp`.
- Use `ensure_future` giving a coroutine as a param to start a new task.
- Schedule the execution of a coroutine: wrap it in a `future <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/asyncio/tasks.py#L243>`_. A task is a subclass of Future.

----

Asyncio basics: Task
====================

Running many tasks concurrently

.. code-block:: python 

    async def task(i):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        return i + 1

    async def foo():
        task = asyncio.ensure_future(task(10))
        return await asyncio.gather(*[task])

----

Asyncio basics: Task
======================

Using the `Future` interface to schedule a callback.

.. code-block:: python 

    async def task(i):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        return i + 1

    def callback(future):
        pritn(future.results())

    def foo():
        task = asyncio.ensure_future(task(10))
        task.add_done_callback(callback)

----


Asyncio basics: Recaping
========================

- **Coroutines** as a way to get concurrence
- **Futures** as a way to pick up results in the future once are available.
- **Tasks** unit of concurrency.

----


Time for coding
===============

Prepare your enviornment

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone\
    https://github.com/Skyscanner/pyday_asyncio_workshop.git
    $ cd pyday_asyncio_workshop.git
    $ mkvirtualenv -p python3
    $ pip install requirements.txt

----

Currency converter HTTP client.
===============================

Implement a HTTP client to convert an amount of money from EUR to another currency

What we expect ?

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python currency/client.py USD 100
    122 USD

----

Currency converter HTTP client.
===============================

- Use the template behind the path `/currency/client.py`
- Use the following API REST endpoint : http://api.fixer.io/latest
- Just fill the code gaps, have fun!

----


TDD in an asynchronous world
============================

As you do usually but with some considerations

.. code-block:: python 

    def test_foo():
        async def _():
            await foo() == 10
        asyncio.get_event_loop().runt_until_complete(_())


----

TDD in an asynchronous world
============================

But we can get some help from `pytest.asyncio`

.. code-block:: python 

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    def test_foo():
        await foo() == 10

----


Currency converter test
=======================

What are we going to do ? Put a fence arround the `convert` function
to test it and get a deterministic behaviour.

How will we do that? Creating an asyncronous fixture and patching
the `get` method to return this, u others, fixture.

----

Currency converter test
=======================

The result expected is :

.. code-block:: python 

    $ pytest -q  tests/currency/
    .
    1 passed in 0.02 seconds

----


Currency converter test
========================

- Use the template behind the path `/test/currency/test_client.py`
- Just fill the code gaps, have fun!


----

Publishing the currency converter as a web resource
===================================================
